		<p>The <a href="{{site.url}}history">pendulum clock</a> in <a href="http://trin.cam.ac.uk">
		Trinity College, Cambridge</a> was installed in 1910.  It is remarkably accurate, known to be better than one second per month.  In 2009 a system was installed to monitor the "going".
		The work was done as part of a 4th year MEng project at the <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/">Engineering Department</a>.
		A sensor on the pendulum detects the going of the clock, which is compared to the accurate time signal from a GPS receiver.
    For an entirely mechanical clock the accuracy is remarkable.
   Watch the clock  <a href="{{site.url}}img/clock_striking_twelve.wmv"> strike twelve </a> or hear it strike twelve at

		Here is a graph for the last 30 days of drift

		A <a href="{{site.url}}barometric"> barometric compensator </a> was installed at clock change - midnight 28 March 2010.

		<br/>
		The clock is regulated as infrequently as possible so as to stay within +/- 5 seconds of the correct time.
This enables the steady-state physics of the clock to be examined without unnecessary interference.

		The black dots &#8226; indicate that there is a comment relating to the time indicated.
Blue arrows pointing down <font color="blue">  &#x25BC; </font> indicate that an adjustment was made to the Going of the clock by removing weights from the pendulum.
Red arrows up <font color="red"> &#x25B2; </font> indicate addition of weights to speed the clock up.
