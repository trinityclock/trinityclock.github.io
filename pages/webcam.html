<p>The webcam is very temperamental (*).  To access live video of the clock you need to do the following:
<br>1. download and install the VLC viewer from <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc">http://www.videolan.org/vlc</a>
<br>2. under Media, Open Network Stream, put   http://hemh1.trin.cam.ac.uk:8080
<br>
Note that there is a stream delay of a few seconds (depending on your network speed and the
number of users).  Also note that the image is not visible at night time
(unless someone happens to be up there to switch the light on). <p>

Interesting things to watch:
<br>- striking the quarters and the hours (the clock is silent from midnight to 07h15, but the hour mechanism still spins);
<br>- winding the clock, usually between 12 noon and 2pm on Tuesdays;
<br>- the time changes:  midnight Last Saturday/Sunday in March;  midnight Last Saturday/Sunday in October.

<p> ( * After a power cut the webcam doesn't always restart properly.  Sorry about this.
Check the Comments page for up-to-date information on webcam status)
<P> ( ** webcam has been out of action for some time, but it is now functioning again - with sound!)
