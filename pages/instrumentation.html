<p>The pendulum is fitted with an infrared optic sensor which is occluded four times per period producing a rectangular wave.  The amplitude at the sensor is about 50mm (100mm peak-peak) and the distance from the fulcrum to the sensor is, conveniently, about 1m - hence the amplitude can be measured in mm or mrad interchangeably.</p>

<p>A GPS receiver generates a 1pps square wave.  This signal is accurate to 10ns, so they say.  The infrared signal and the GPS signal are digitised simultaneously by a datalogger (ADC).  Some clever data processing permits the pendulum period and amplitude to be deduced to high accuracy, once every 3 seconds.</p>

<p>A weather station measures temperature, pressure and humidity.  Air density is calculated from these three properties according to an accepted formula.  The data is logged once every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>All the data is saved on a local PC running OpenSuse (Linux).  The data processing is performed in C++.  Data is uploaded to the server every 3 hours.</p>

<p>There is a lot more we'd like to measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>motion of the tower (perhaps glitches are related to seismic activity);</li>
<li>install variable drag on the pendulum to neutralise sensitvity to air pressure changes;</li>
<li>air currents up the pendulum chamber (air flowing up or down will change the amplitude and going);</li>
<li>measure the actual time displayed on the clock face (we detect only seconds, and can't tell which second we're on)</li>
<li>sound (it'd be nice to hear the ticking realtime and also the bells)</li>
<li>winding alert (it would be good to get a warning before the clock stops, if we forget to wind it)</li>
<li>and of course we need the webcam working...</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone wants to help, then please contact the Keeper of the Clock.</p>
