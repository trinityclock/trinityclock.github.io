title: Barometric Compensation

At the clock change, just after midnight on 28 March 2010, a trial barometric compensator was installed.  The idea is to correct for the slope of the "going vs pressure" graph.  The slope is  about -8ms/day per mbar and the main effect appears to be buoyancy caused by change in air density.  The objective is to adjust the compensator to get a zero gradient.  The <a href="{{site.url}}theory/barocomptheory.pdf">theory of a barometric compensator</a> is a bit subtle.
<br>Here is the data from the first 4 weeks since compensation, compared with before compensation:
